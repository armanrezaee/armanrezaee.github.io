    Research summary
</h3>
<p class="bottomspace">
My research seeks to understand how to improve
government services in fragile states. I focus in particular on rural
settings, where the majority of the world's population live and where
government services suffer from low employee effort. In my job market paper, I
show that cost-effective, self-sustaining, and scalable crowd-sourcing
technology can be harnessed to improve government performance in Pakistan and
subsequently the welfare of rural Pakistanis. I am also interested in how
personality traits of government employees matter for efforts to improve
government services through increased transparency, as well as how governments
decide where to offer services in the first place. My research makes use of
large-scale field experiments that leverage cellular technology, as well as
natural experiments using historical archival data. Much of my work focuses on
Pakistan. I also have active projects in Uganda and the Philippines.

and Yasir Khan.
<br>
<i>Funding from the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI), the International Growth Centre (IGC), and the UC Lab Fees Research
Program.</i>
<br><br> We develop and implement a novel, mobile phone-based information clearinghouse, and experimentally evaluate 
its ability to overcome information asymmetries and improve public service delivery to farmers in Punjab, Pakistan. 
Like many crowdsourcing websites, our clearinghouse collects and disseminates ratings&#8212;here, on the success 
of government veterinarians in inseminating livestock. We find that, compared to control, farmers receiving 
ratings enjoy 27 percent higher insemination success. This effect is entirely due to increased veterinarian 
effort, rather than farmers switching veterinarians. Treatment farmers are also 33 percent more likely to 
return to a government veterinarian rather than seeking a private provider. These results suggest large 
welfare benefits from a low-cost information intervention, which holds out hope for improved government 
accountability for the poor using basic mobile technology.

<br>
<i>Under review.</i>
<br><br>
This paper provides evidence that the personality traits of policy actors matter for policy
outcomes in the context of two large-scale experiments in Punjab, Pakistan. Three results
support the relevance of personalities for policy outcomes. First, doctors with higher Big Five
and Perry Public Sector Motivation scores attend work more and falsify inspection reports
less. Second, health inspectors who score higher on these personality measures exhibit a larger
treatment response to increased monitoring. Last, senior health officials with higher Big Five
scores are more likely to respond to a report of an underperforming facility by compelling better
subsequent staff attendance.

<br><br>
Why do substantial swathes of territory within the boundaries of administratively competent states remain ungoverned
for long periods of time? We explore this question in the context of a unique set of legal institutions in Pakistan that
clearly demarcate spaces that are to be left ungoverned. During colonial rule, the British divided Pakistan into two
distinct regions. The first was the Raj, where the British built modern political and bureaucratic institutions. In the
second region, the British put a small number of political agents in charge of tribal areas and codified pre-colonial
institutions in the Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR). Legal decisions were left to customary law carried out by local
tribal councils, or Jirgas. Though the area under FCR has steadily decreased, FCR is still in place in the tribal areas
of Pakistan today. Pakistan therefore offers a prime case in why governments leave certain territory ungoverned. Using
primary legal documents we create a dataset of when and where FCR applied in Pakistan between 1901 and 2012 at the sub-district level. 
We then exploit the differential impact of the Green Revolution on potential land revenue at the sub-district level to empirically test 
a simple model in which states extend governance to areas where the economic benefits
of developing full institutions through taxation and resource extraction outweigh the costs of doing so. We find that
sub-districts that would see a disproportionate increase in potential land revenue as a result of the Green Revolution
were disproportionately more likely to have FCR removed following the advent of the Green Revolution.

"Increasing SME productivity in Uganda: Levereging clusters to train and scale," with Sarojini Hirshleifer and Benjamin Kachero.
<br>
<i>Pilot funding from East Africa Social Science Translation (EASST) Secretariat acting on behalf of the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) and from Private Enterprise Development in Low-Income Countries (PEDL)</i>
<br><br>
Low productivity is a major constraint to growth in developing countries (in both agricultural and nonagricultural sectors). 
Furthermore, recent micro-level evidence finds that small business owners and farmers do not fully understand how to optimize 
their production processes suggesting that knowledge may be a barrier to productivity growth. Small firms may also face 
challenges in reaching the scale required to access markets. Thus, the Ugandan Investment Authority in collaboration with 
Makerere University has developed a cluster-level intervention to help SMEs grow. The intervention: (i) provides technical 
training that is designed to increase productivity (as well as business training) and (ii) leverages bringing firms together 
as a cluster to help them reach the economies of scale needed to ship products to markets and/or negotiate input prices. 
This study seeks to answer whether jointly providing technical knowledge and assistance in reaching economies of scale 
can cost-effectively increase productivity growth of small and medium enterprises.

"Crowd-sourced air pollution monitoring in Pakistan," with Matthew Gibson.
<br>
<i>Travel funding from J-PAL Governance Initiative.</i>
<br><br>
In Pakistan, as in much of the developing world, air pollution continues unchecked at a level that 
is privately optimal for firms. In many Pakistani cities annual average PM10 concentrations exceed 
200 micrograms/m3, well above the EPA's 24-hour standard of 150 micrograms/m3 (Colbeck et al. 2010). While 
environmental enforcement in Pakistan is currently poor, the state has capacity that could be tapped 
to improve environmental quality. Citizens could be empowered to pressure government and firms. 
However, anecdotal evidence suggests that two important roadblocks stand in their way---1) a lack of 
information, and 2) collective action problems. We propose to implement a cross-cutting, randomized 
controlled trial across 160 villages of Sheikhupera, Punjab, Pakistan, with two interventions. The 
first intervention will ease information constraints through a cell-phone-based black carbon (BC) 
analysis method developed by Nexleaf Analytics. Through this very cost-effective method, citizens
 with a cell phone in project villages will receive instant BC readings via SMS, three times per 
 week, informing them about a pollutant known to harm health (Janssen et al. 2012). The second 
 intervention will address collective action issues by building on a proven model of community 
 engagement from a successful health program in Uganda (Bjorkman and Svensson 2009).

"Integrating Isolated Communities: How Does First-Time Mobile Phone Access Affect Remote Communities in the Philippines?" with Joshua Blumenstock, Niall Keleher, and Erin Troland.
<br><br>
We have secured a unique opportunity to
experimentally evaluate the impact of introducing greenfield cellular networks into several remote and hitherto-unconnected 
villages in the Philippines. Over the coming year, researchers at the University of Philippines, in
collaboration with Endaga, a private technology company, will install 15 new cellular phone towers in remote
barangays (villages) in the Philippines. These "community cellular networks" (CCN) are locally owned and operated
networks that provide mobile phone connectivity to regions of the world that lack traditional mobile phone coverage.
Since there are at least 30 candidate villages eligible to receive a CCN, random selection will ensure that there is a
viable control group of barangays that never get a CCN (at least in the immediate future). We aim to answer three questions: 1) how does 
first-time access to mobile phone networks affect how people in remote communities communicate with, and 
form connections to, individuals outside of their home community?; 2) to what extent do these connections to the "outside world" 
provide community members with access to new information, new economic opportunities, and new modes of civic engagement?; and 3) what are 
the net social and economic impacts of providing first-time mobile phone network access to previously disconnected communities?

"Quality testing to address a market for lemons in Pakistan," with Ali Hasanain and Yasir Khan.
<br>
<i>Pilot funding from Private Enterprise Development for Low-Income Countries (PEDL).</i>
<br><br>
Asymmetric information about quality should create a market for lemons (Akerlof 1970). We have completed a pilot study documenting that the there is a lemons market for untreated 
milk in Lahore, Pakistan, due to informal, self-employed milkmen having asymmetric information about 
their milk's quality. At the same time, we piloted two technologies that allow households to measure milk quality at low costs along two different dimensions (watering down of milk and the adding specific adulterants). 
We next plan to introduce these technologies as a large-scale cross-cutting RCT. We seek to understand how sellers 
and consumers react to information about seller quality in a setting where the literature suggests that the impact of these technologies can both be beneficial 
(Chatterji and Toffel, 2010) and/or perverse (Espeland and Sauder, 2007). We also seek to study specific heterogeneities in milkmen's response to relieveing asymmetric information.
